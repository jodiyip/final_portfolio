        <p>Designed a user flow map that finds the most reviewed burger restaurant in Ann Arbor, Michigan on the Yelp mobile app. Tracked each user movement using solid lines. Dotted lines represent the next screen after tapping an interaction point. Interaction points are represented with a hollow yellow circle. Error conditions are how users can go back if they make a mistake. Error conditions are represented with a yellow X. <br>The assignment was created for SI 422: User Experience and Accesibility. I created the layout on Adobe Illustrator.</p>

        <p>Wireframed a new app design for the Nichols Arboretum in Ann Arbor. I designed a new logo and app icons. The app wireframe includes a camera features that allows the user to take a photo of a flower and identify the flower. There is also a screen about upcoming events at the Arb. Users can receive more information about the event and mark whether they are attending. There is also a screen of trail maps.<br> I chose the color scheme to complement my logo design color. This assignment was made for SI 320: Graphic Design on Adobe Illustrator.</p>

        <p>Created an avocado infographic about the nutritional information, harvest process, background. I chose the colors to match the colors of the avocado picture. I includes different qualities of the fruit including taste, texture, calories and price. The breakdown of categories show how subheadliens and body text look like. The nutritional information shows how the bar chart graphics would look like. <br>This project was created for my SI 320: Graphic Design course. This was designed using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
